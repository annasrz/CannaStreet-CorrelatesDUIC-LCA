# Correlates of Driving Under the Influence of Cannabis: Latent Class Analysis

This repository contains R scripts for a study exploring driving under the influence of cannabis (DUIC) among regular cannabis users in Germany. Using data from a pre-legalization survey of drivers who consume cannabis at least monthly, we employed Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to identify distinct DUIC risk profiles.  The analysis examines various factors such as sociodemographic variables, mental health indicators, and risk perceptions. The code includes data preparation, selection of relevant variables, and the application of LCA models with and without covariates. 

Additionally, results include model fit statistics, classification metrics, and odds ratios for covariates associated with class membership. Visualization of findings is provided through profile plots and regression coefficient plots. This work aims to better understand the underlying patterns of cannabis use and its implications for driving behavior, contributing valuable insights into public health and policy discussions.
